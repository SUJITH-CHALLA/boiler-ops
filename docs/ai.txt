# BoilerOps - Application Overview for AI Analysis

## 1. Project Description
BoilerOps is a digital logbook and operational management system designed for industrial boiler plants. It replaces traditional paper logs with a secure, role-based digital platform to track steam generation, fuel consumption, staff attendance, and equipment breakdowns.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Vercel Postgres)
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 (Credentials Provider)

## 3. User Roles & Access Control
The application implements strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with four distinct levels:

### A. Operator
- **Focus:** Data Entry & Execution.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Log hourly boiler readings (Pressure, Temperature, Shift, Reading Time).
  - Report immediate breakdowns.
  - Restricted from viewing historical records, analytics, or modifying past logs.
  - Access to a simplified "Operator Console".

### B. Shift Incharge
- **Focus:** Shift Management & Supervision.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Submit end-of-shift summaries (Fuel consumed, Steam flow start/end, Blowdown status).
  - View and Edit Shift Logs.
  - Manage Shift Attendance (Mark staff present).
  - View plant performance analytics.
  - View historical records (Shift Logs, Attendance, Breakdowns).

### C. Engineer
- **Focus:** Technical Oversight.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Includes all Incharge capabilities.
  - Access to Admin Console (managing form fields, user management).
  - Technical analysis of breakdown trends.

### D. Manager
- **Focus:** Analytics & Audit.
- **Capabilities:**
  - **View-Only Access** to all logs (cannot edit/tamper).
  - **Advanced Dashboard:** Detailed charts for Fuel Consumption, Steam Pressure Consistency, Breakdown Frequency, and Steam Generation.
  - **Quick Incident Feed:** View latest breakdown reports directly on the dashboard.
  - **Audit Records:** Access to full Shift Logs, Hourly Logs, and Attendance Reports.
  - **Reporting:** Ability to print detailed daily/shift reports and export data to CSV.

## 4. Key Workflows

### 4.1. Shift Logging Process
1.  **Hourly:** Operators submit readings every hour via the "Hourly Log" form. They specify the "Reading Time" to ensure accuracy.
2.  **End of Shift:** The Shift Incharge reviews hourly inputs and submits a "Shift Summary" which captures aggregate data (Total Fuel, Total Steam, Handover Remarks).
3.  **Audit:** Managers review these logs in the "Records" section, with the ability to drill down into hourly details per shift.

### 4.2. Breakdown Management
- Any user (except Manager view-only) can report a breakdown.
- Breakdowns are tracked as "Active" or "Resolved".
- Resolving a breakdown requires entering "Action Taken" and "Downtime Minutes".
- Managers see a live feed of recent incidents.

### 4.3. Attendance System
- Attendance is recorded per shift (A, B, C).
- Incharges mark staff present for their shift.
- System generates daily reports grouping staff by shift.
- Reports are printable (PDF) and exportable (CSV).

## 5. Major Features Implemented
- **Digital Logbook:** Replaces physical registers with timestamped, immutable (for operators) digital records.
- **Professional Reporting:** Custom CSS optimization to print clean, professional reports (browsers headers/footers removed, single-page layout for hourly logs).
- **Analytics Visualization:** Interactive charts for key performance indicators (KPIs) like Fuel Efficiency and Steam Output.
- **Audit Trails:** All logs record `createdById` and timestamps. Includes "Reading Time" for precise hourly tracking.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly for floor operators; Desktop-optimized for managers.
- **Secure Authentication:** Role-based sessions with easy Sign-Out access via the Navbar.

## 6. Design System
The application uses a specific professional industrial color palette:
- **Primary:** `#1E3A5F` (Deep Blue) - Used for headers, primary buttons, and emphasis.
- **Secondary:** `#4A5568` (Slate Gray) - Used for secondary text and muted elements.
- **Accent:** `#2F855A` (Safety Green) - Used for active states, success indicators, and positive trends.
- **Destructive:** `#C53030` (Red) - Used for alerts, breakdowns, and danger zones.
- **Background:** `#ffffff` (White) - Clean background for readability and print optimization.
- **Muted:** `#E2E8F0` (Light Gray) - Used for borders and subtle backgrounds.

## 7. Context for AI Improvement
Use this overview to identify:
- Potential security gaps or enhancements.
- Logic improvements for industrial plant operations (e.g., automated efficiency calculations).
- Missing standard CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) features.
- UX improvements for low-tech environments.
