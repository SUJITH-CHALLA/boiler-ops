PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Product Name (working)

BoilerOps
(Internal tool – not customer-facing branding)
1. Problem Statement
Boiler operations are currently tracked using paper logbooks, verbal handovers, and scattered registers, leading to:
Missing or inaccurate data

No accountability by shift or operator

Difficulty during audits and inspections

No historical visibility for breakdowns or fuel usage

High dependency on individuals instead of systems

2. Product Goal (MVP)

Replace paper-based boiler logs with a secure, login-based web app that operators use daily, producing timestamped, reliable data.

Success = paper logs stop being used for the selected boiler.

3. Target Users
Primary

Boiler Operator

Enters shift data

Marks attendance

Logs breakdowns

Secondary

Supervisor

Uses data for reporting and audits

No external users. No public access.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Simple UX (low typing, large buttons)

Works on Chrome / Edge / Mobile browsers

8. Data Integrity Rules

Every record must store:

Created at

No delete for operators

Supervisor delete only if absolutely required (logged)

No shared accounts

9. Success Metrics (MVP Validation)

After 30 days:

≥90% shifts logged digitally

Operators can complete entries in <3 minutes

If this fails → fix UX, not features.
